# Building a Real-time Chat App with ReactJs and Firebase. :writing_hand:

Built by following the article from Timonwa on [Building a Real-time Chat App with ReactJs and Firebase](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-a-real-time-chat-app-with-reactjs-and-firebase/) for [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/)

This Chat App utilizes Firebases Google Authentication to login using Gmail as users, and sends/stores messages to Firebases online database in a global chat. 

It has some minor variations from the example on original article, due to issues with authentications method provided as well as tighter control on avatar availabilities. But the final result should be similar, a fully functional online chat app that stores messages permanently.
